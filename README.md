# Laptop_Price_predictor
Introduction
The Laptop Price Predictor is a machine learning project designed to predict laptop prices based on key features like brand, processor, RAM, and storage. It aims to help consumers and retailers make informed decisions about laptop pricing.

Motivation
With countless laptop configurations on the market, pricing can be complex. This project aims to simplify the process by using machine learning to predict prices based on specifications, making it easier for buyers and sellers to evaluate value.

Project Workflow
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the dataset, with no missing values.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized relationships between laptop features and prices.
Model Building: Tested multiple models (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest), with Random Forest yielding the highest accuracy.
Model Evaluation: Assessed using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Prediction: The final model predicts laptop prices based on input features.

Technologies Used
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn.

Conclusion
This project provides an efficient tool for predicting laptop prices, offering insights for both consumers and retailers. Future plans include model deployment for broader accessibility.
