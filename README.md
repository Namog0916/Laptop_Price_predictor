# Laptop Price Predictor

## Introduction
The **Laptop Price Predictor** is a machine learning project designed to predict laptop prices based on key features like brand, processor, RAM, and storage.  
It aims to help consumers and retailers make informed decisions about laptop pricing.

## Motivation
With countless laptop configurations on the market, pricing can be complex.  
This project simplifies the process by using machine learning to predict prices based on specifications, making it easier for buyers and sellers to evaluate value.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and prepared the dataset, with no missing values.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualized relationships between laptop features and prices.
3. **Model Building**: Tested multiple models (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest), with Random Forest yielding the highest accuracy.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Assessed using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
5. **Prediction**: The final model predicts laptop prices based on input features.
